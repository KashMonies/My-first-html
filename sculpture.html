		<h1 class="h1">The Division of the Sheep from the Goats</h1>
		<div class="pic1"><img src="DSC_0335.jpg"></div>
		<p class="p">	This piece was made for an outdoor exhibition at the Casalin Artspace in Miami, FL.
		 The theme of the show was the end of the world. I based the work on a bible passage, Matthew 25, 
		 in which the “Judgement of Nations” is metaphorically described as the division of sheep from goats.
		  In the work the sheep which should be ascending to heaven get caught in a tree.   
		  (chicken wire, foam, wood, synthetic hair, modeling paste, buttons, shoe polish, 
		   acrylic paint cotton batting , and various fabrics) </p>
